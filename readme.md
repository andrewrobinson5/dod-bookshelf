# andrewrobinson5's Big Data-Oriented-Design Bookshelf

Welcome to my DOD Bookshelf.

If you're looking for magic, look somewhere else. I'm not any kind of authority on programming or program design or FP or OOP or, as the name here suggests, DOD.
My intention for this repository is that it'd be a public log of all the resources I'm using to learn the ins and outs of DOD, the ergonomic access patterns, table-oriented data storage, benchmarks, and theory behind clever cache usage and for writing very high performance software.

## Journals
I'll be writing study journals in the `journals/` directory. This will be small things I've learned, what I read related to DOD on a day, what I tried, questions I have that I'd like to explore further, and other things the likes of which are too informal to call research. These are just for my own future reference, but if you are interested in searching them for relevant info, be my guest.

## Essays
More formally than `journals/` entries, I'll occasionally write essays (in `essays/`) that dive deeper into specific aspects of DOD and what I've been learning, benchmarking, and trying out, and what systems I've been implementing with DOD. Hopefully these can be of reference to programmers looking to get into Data-Oriented-Design, as there's not a lot of high quality information on it.

## Sources
In `sources/`, I'll add my tests and toys and tiny example projects written with the purpose of practicing DOD. Refrain from using these as examples to follow, as I am just a student of the paradigm.

## Benchmarks
Finally, since the performance of access patterns can be hard to intuit when considering cache usage against algorithmic efficiency, when presented with multiple ways to conquer a task, we'd all do well to try each option and see what works best for the shapes and sizes of data we need on the platforms we use. `benchmarks/` will serve as a deposit for source code for testing code with similar goals and gathering and comparing the results.

# Contributing
If you would like to contribute benchmarks/sources/readings, feel free to drop in a pull-request, and I'll consider adding it to the repository. I want to keep this scoped down to a personal resource so I may not merge the requests, but when you contribute you're sending good information my way, which I greatly appreciate.
